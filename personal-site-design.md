    My target audience are the Dev Academy instructors who are monitoring my progress but also other students to learn from and later potenial employers to see any previous work that I have developed.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

    I want people to leave feeling like they have abit of insight into who Benjamin Tairea is, and also he his outlook and certain things. I want to have no trouble utlising the website and make it easy for them to manoeuvre through the website.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

    I'll be honest with the content so that people will hopefully get a feel for who i am. 
    But as for design; I will implement elements that reflect my outlook specific to the content that is shown on the page, such as images and colours that are representative of 'me'. I will also include a navigation panel in constant view to make it easier for the user to move through the site.
